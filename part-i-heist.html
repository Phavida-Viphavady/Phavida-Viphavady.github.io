             <p class="timeline__content-desc">Two white men disguised in Boston police uniform with moustaches and glasses rang the bell of one of the museum entrances and demanded to be let in to check the museum for disturbance. Rick Abath, one of the night guards at the watch desk, decided to break the museum's protocol and let the two men in. When the men were inside, they ordered Rick to call another guard who was doing a round. Then the men handcuffed them, wrapped their eyes, ears, and    mouths with tape, and locked them in the basement.</p>
